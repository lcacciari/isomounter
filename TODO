* add command line arguments handling
   at a minmum, we should have standard options like --help or --version
   
   
* add "query" modes: a way to have the program give info on already mounted images
   This will require to write a local mtab file (Ã  la fuseiso) and some command line
   options. An alternative would be to have a daemon handling all mounts, but this
   seems to be an overkill

   

* Integrate with graphic mode. This will require some steps:
- have the program launch a file browser on the mount point when done
   beware of the fact that the code after the call to fuse_main could be executed
   twice! Onche by the father process, another when the daemonized process. BTW
   what that it means for the free done there?
- write a manager with a cute interface :-P
