	isomounter - mount a ISO9660 image file in userspace using fuse

  isomounter is a Linux utility that allows you to mount an ISO9660 file
  just as if you had it on an acual CD and you put it into your computer's
  CD reader.

  isomounter leverages on the FUSE infrastructure to allow mounting the
  image in userspace, thus not neading to be root to do it. It uses
  the cdio library by Gnu to handle access to the image file.

  The isomounter project born during the end-of-the-year days. I was
  actually looking for a way to mount a CD image on my xubuntu system
  and come across a couple of programs doing just that, but none had
  all the features I was looking for (nor has isomounter, yet, but I'm
  working on it), so I looked to their code to see if they could be
  brought to do things as I wanted.

  This brought out some other problems with these progams themselves,
  which discouraged me until I remember the qualities of the "good
  programmer", namely:
  
               Laziness, Impatience, and Hubris
	       
  and I started programming it myself.

  Current version is yet in a very early alpha stage, but wouldn't
  stay as such for long (fingers crossed).
